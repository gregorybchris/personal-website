    "description": "TSA: The Stealing Administration was a final project for my college visualization class in collaboration with Zach Kirsch. We build a web visualization tool that allowed users to explore which airports receive the most reports of theft. Since the advent of strict American airport security post 2001, theft among TSA agents has been the subject of multiple news stories. We built the visualization around the idea that people care most about airports they visit often. We make it easy to explore all claims filed to the TSA under different categories like electronics, clothing, or jewelry and see how often those claims are accepted.",
