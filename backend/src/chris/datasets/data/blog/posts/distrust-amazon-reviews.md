The other day I was shopping for a new bed-side lamp. On sites of well-known brands (Ikea, Pottery Barn, etc.) it was sometimes hard to tell from the pictures if I'd be getting a quality product. Then I tried the classic "Best Lamps of 2025" listicles (I have to imagine were full of paid placements). [NYT Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter) had some fine options too. From Google searches I stumbled across a few sites with artsy lamps in the <i>thousands</i> of dollars. Hey, no judgement if that's your thing, but I'm a simple man. I want a sturdy lamp that'll last me a few decades and not break the bank.

At least for me, this is a pretty common experience buying a product online. I have a dollar amount in mind that I think a good enough lamp is worth -- perhaps $50 let's say? And I want to find a product that fits my expectations for product quality. But then I go online and I'm flooded with options, many of which are super high quality, but cost an arm and a leg, and many of which look potentially well-constructed at first, but upon closer inspection would likely break or a year or maybe even in transit to my front door.

Gaussian belief propagation for marketplace optimization

TrueScore considers how users rate items in an online marketplace and provides a measure of rater reliability using Gaussian belief propagation. The model jointly learns to estimate item quality and user reliability from data, putting less weight on ratings from users determined to be less reliable. As rater reliability changes, so do item quality estimates, hence the "propagation" in Gaussian belief propagation.
