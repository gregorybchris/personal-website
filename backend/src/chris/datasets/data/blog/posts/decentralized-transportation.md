title: What If All Roads Were Toll Roads?

I want to talk about decentralized autonomous transportation. Never heard of it? I made it up. Was I the first to invent it? Probably not. But admittedly I haven't gone down the deep deep rabbit hole that is transit nerd internet, so for now, I'll just imagine it's my own creation.

Let me explain what I mean -- What would the world look like if all cars were _truly_ autonomous?<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a class="fnref" href="#fn:fn1">[1]</a></sup> And I don't just mean they can get you from your garage to your office parking lot. I mean they can operate totally without human intervention, filling up gas when they "want" to, going to the shop for repairs on their own accord, even deciding for themselves when to pick up passengers and how much to charge them.

While we're at it with the sci-fi, what if roads were autonomous too? Monitoring their own degradation, scheduling pothole repair, determining what fares to charge passersby to maximize profit without driving away customers. (get it, _driving_?)

With specialized AI getting cheaper and cheaper, this picture of a futuristic transportation system may not be so far-fetched as it seems.

### Autonomous government

This free-market can't work forever, can it? I don't think so. We can't afford crumbling road infrastructure lying around. Evolution is just not efficient. But we can use the tools of science to make predictions and avoid the waste of trial and error, survival of the fittest.

[Braess' paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27_paradox) -- adding a road can actually slow down overall traffic flow.

## Outline

- Cars charge as much as they can before people stop paying
- Roads charge as much as they can before cars stop paying (all roads are toll roads)
- The government can propose a new road and it will be built if people pledge enough funds
- There are buses and vans as well
- Cars pay for gas and pay to go to the shop
