Decentralized autonomous transportation

The core idea is "what if we took automation and free markets to the extreme?" What would urban transportation look like if the cost of specialized AI went to zero and cars and roads were autonomous agents with the responsibility to pay their own way?

## Outline

- Cars charge as much as they can before people stop paying
- Roads charge as much as they can before cars stop paying (all roads are toll roads)
- The government can propose a new road and it will be built if people pledge enough funds
- There are buses and vans as well
- Cars pay for gas and pay to go to the shop
